A slapped-together code experiment to test out [manifoldJS](http://www.manifoldjs.com/). 

## Things I did

* Hosted the web app on a tiny server out on the Intertubes.
* Ran `manifoldjs [app domain]` to compile the source files for Android Studio.
* Followed the Android instructions on the [manifoldJS deployment documentation](http://www.manifoldjs.com/deploy).
* Made an app!

## Things you can do

* Download the APK and run the app on your Android device.
* Run the app locally on your favorite browser with `node server.js`.
* Compile the source files for development with `gulp build`.
* Compile the source files for production with `gulp build --watch`.
* Not judge the slight code mess.
